Took an extremely Long time figuring out the lower end Y (the smaller the lower) bound.
Messy code and notes. Section Width, root start, root endY, etc.
Are not clear enough.


Also, the number of times got wrong. Should be power of 2, instead of 2+1. 


Then, the boundary case. Use Math.min, Math.max, Math.cil, Math.floor accordingly.

For routing, took a while to figure out how to get the vertices. 
对class, function还是似是而非的用法。
